"""Usage: includes_parent_header.py

This script is intended to find instances where a given *.cc or *.hh
doesn't include it's "parent" file as the first include.
That is, if a *.cc doesn't include the identically named *.hh file,
or a *.hh doesn't include the corresponding *.fwd.hh

It will only print results for instance where the parent file actually
exists, so if a corresponding *.hh or *.fwd.hh is omitted, it will be
ignored.

Additionally, the script will complain even if the parent include is present,
but is not the very first header included in the file.

This script is intended to be run from the Rosetta/main/source/src directory,
and will automatically scan all the subdirectories.
