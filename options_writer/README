This script is useful when converting an application-defined Mover (in its original use case, coupled_moves) into a protocols library Mover.  Application-defined options have to move to options_rosetta.py to do this.  The script takes lines of code that are sed-able or awk-able from the .cc file and outputs python to copy into options_rosetta.py.  What the input ought to look like is present as input_sample.  I did the conversion semi-manually for the one use case, so I don't have that first command line handy, sorry!
