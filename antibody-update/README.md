# RosettaAntibody Database

RosettaAntibody is a hybrid homology/_de novo_ modeling approach for
predicting antibody structure. As such, it is highly dependent on a
database for antibody CDR and Framework templates.

The below text is true for the following git shas/branches:
- rosetta/main: lqtza/scs_blast_updates_for_auto_db, 4db3fed871
- rosetta/tools: lqtza/update-ab-db, [insert sha]

## Database Contents

Briefly, the database has four categories of contents:

- PDBs
    - Chothia numbered
- BLAST databases
    - Generated by extracting sequences from the above PDBs.
- "Info" files
    - Generated by extracting sequences from the above PDBs.
    - Used for filtering by sequence identity or for selecting additional
    templates (by randomly matching length).
- Metric files
    - _E.g._ B factors or OCDs used as quality filters.


### PDBs

I do not know 100% how the previous PDBs were selected. As of early 2019, we
are moving towards automating PDB cultivation. As we are not experts in
identifying antibodies from the PDB, we rely on SAbDab and pull the PDBs they
have cultivated (with resolution better than 3 Angstroms).

The PDBs are Chothia numbered and this is necessary because most antibody
code works under that assumption.

### BLAST Databases

BLAST databases are generated for the CDR L1, L2, L3, H1, H2, H3 regions, the
FRH and FRL regions, a combined "light-heavy" region for template selection.
For the CDRs, these database are separated by length. The FRH/L databases
should all be the same length (there are no variable insertions in the
framework regions). The "light-heavy" is a single database, but uses the full
sequence of the antibody for some reason, so it varies in length.

To generate the databases, sequences are extracted from the PDBs, assuming
Chothia numbering. One issue here is how to handle missing residues. The
current approach excludes regions if they are missing residues. Region
definitions (in the Chothia numbering scheme) are below. Definitions are
inclusive so H1 includes residue 26 and 35.

**Heavy-chain CDRs**
- H1: 26–35
- H2: 50–65
- H3: 95–102

**Light-chain CDRs**
- L1: 24–34
- L2: 50–56
- L3: 89–97

**Frameworks**
- FRH: 10–25, 36–39, 46–49, 66–94, 103–109
- FRL: 10–23, 35–39, 46–49, 57–66, 71–88, 98–104

**Light-heavy (orientation)**
- Heavy: 5–109
- Light: 5–104


### Info Files

The ranges above are used to extract sequences for the `antibody.info`,
`cdr.info`, `frh.info`, `frl.info`, and `frlh.info` files. In the older
database, some files use and underscore ("_") instead of a period ("."). These
info files are used to generate the BLAST database, except for `antibody.info`,
which is used by the C++ grafting code for filtering/appending results.

### Metrics for Filtering

Finally, there are several "quality" metrics antibody.cc uses to filter out
potential models. Previously, these came from three files: `list_bfactor50`,
`comparisons.txt`, and `outlier_list`. I must speculated on the origin of all
but one of these files. I know the `comparisons.txt` files contains OCD
(see Marze, Lyskov, and Gray [PEDS, 2016]) values for all pairs of antibodies.
These capture the orientation differences and were calculated using Nick's
pilot app (packing_angle, I think). I assume the `list_bfactor50` labels each
CDR region as "true" if that region either has a single (or average) B-factor
value above 50. I have no idea about the outlier list -- possibly it was there
to exclude antibodies that issues grafting? In the automated version of the
antibody database, I do not produce an outlier list.

### Conserved Residues

During grafting (grafter.cc line 182-ish), a set of conserved framework residues
is used to align the FRH and FRL templates to the orientation template. If these
residues are missing from templates, then this grafting step will fail. So,
when constructing the database, we check for the presence of the following
residues:

- **Heavy**
  - 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25,
  - 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49,
  - 66,
  - 69, 70, 71, 72,
  - 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94,
  - 103, 104, 105

- **Light**
  - 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23,
  - 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49,
  - 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66,
  - 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88,
  - 98, 99, 100

## Current Status

There is now a single script (create_antibody_db.py) which will:

1. Download all sub-3.0 Angstrom antibody structures from SAbDab.
2. Select single Fab from each PDB and truncate to Fv.
3. Extract sequences for the above regions and check for structural issues.
4. Generate BLAST database from the info files (generated in step 3).
5. Calculated OCDs and extract B-factors.

Selecting a single Fv is not done rationally at the moment. In the future,
we should select by chain with most resolved regions rather than first reported
chain in SAbDab summary file.

The runtime is a bit slow as it loads PDBs into PyRosetta twice (steps 3 & 5).

The script probably can be optimized in a few ways as I initially just sought
to replicate the previous database.

### Replication of The Previous Database

It was not possible (why?) to perfectly replicate the previous database.
These statistics are as of Feb. 15th, 2019. Overall statistics indicate
an increase in template sources:

| Region | Old # | New # | Overlapping # |
| ------ | ----- | ----- | ------------- |
| All CDRs | 1902 | 2611 | 1560 |
| FRH | 1785 | 2390 | 1427 |
| FRL | 1577 | 1832 | 1111 |
| Orientation | 1003 | 1721 | 749 |

The overlapping PDBs could be used to compare sequences and metrics. I found
most PDBs agreed. Below I report mismatches and discuss a few reasons for them.

| Region | Mismatches |
| ------ | ---------- |
| CDR H1 | 30 |
| CDR H2 | 60 |
| CDR H3 | 33 |
| CDR L1 | 11 |
| CDR L2 | 15 |
| CDR L3 | 8 |
| FRH | 27 |
| FRL | 3 |
| Orientation | 11 |

In general, mismatches occur at rates of ~1–2%, but why?

#### CDR H1 Mismatches

**Present in new database, but not in old (3)**

- 3qxu
- 1yc7
- 1mvf

These PDBs are missing H1 atoms in the old database (not sure why), but not
in the new one. Hence they are now included.

**Present in old database, but not in new (18)**

- 1ol0
- 4at6
- 3c5s (multiple Fvs, the selected one has a chainbreak)
- 2p46
- 2p44
- 2p45
- 2p42
- 2p43
- 2p48
- 4tuj
- 4jzn
- 2p47
- 4y5y
- 4k3e (multiple Fvs, the selected one has a chainbreak)
- 4jn2
- 1oay has multiple Fvs in the PDB (new PDB select VHH with chainbreak)
- 1oax has multiple Fvs in the PDB (new PDB select VL only)
- 1oau has multiple Fvs in the PDB (new PDB selects VHH with chainbreak)

These are a mix of antibodies. Spot checking a few: 4jzn, 4jn2, and 1oay have
missing atoms in the new H1. This indicates that we are not optimally selecting
H/L chains (because these breaks were not previously present).

**Present in both, but with different sequences (8)**

- 1pg7 has multiple Fvs in the PDB
- 4nzr
- 4krp has multiple Fvs in the PDB
- 4rgn has multiple Fvs in the PDB
- 4k7p has the wrong sequence in the old antibody_info file
- 5bv7 has multiple Fvs in the PDB
- 4nc1 has the wrong sequence in the old antibody_info file
- 3zkx has multiple Fvs in the PDB

This is likely due to the presence of multiple antibodies in the PDB.
See 3zkx or 5bv7 as examples (I did not inspect all 9).
We currently, only select one (though we could do multiple by implementing
something like append an A/B/C... to the end of the PDB ID). Previously,
all Fvs were extracted for the info file, but only one appears to be present
in the PDB (which is a bad mistake because you might BLAST align to one thing
and then graft another).

- 5bv7 has multiple Fvs in the PDB
- 3mlr has a super long L3 that is truncated in the old PDB

#### FRH Mismatches (27)

A few happen when there are surprise insertions (at positions not) expected.
This ruins the assumption of a constant FRH, but only in a way, since the
surprise insertions are in non-CDR loops (mostly DE, I think).
Maybe we should be considering only the beta strands for the FRH/FRL templating?
And begin grafting the H4/DE?

Other issues here are that our previous numbering the FRH (around 66) was not
identical to actual Chothia numbering.

- 4ydl numbering differs (66S vs. 66K, but LS after K missing in the new Fv
because they are numbered by a rare insertion at 66).
- 4ydj has a super long H3 that is truncated in the old PDB and affects the frh
- 1pg7 has multiple Fvs in the PDB
- 5mje has "surprise" insertions at 73 that are "missed"
- 4toy has a missing DE loop in the old PDB so is misnumbered
- 3uyr has different numbering in the old PDB (unclear why)
- 1e4x has multiple Fvs in the PDB
- 4nzr has a super long H3 that is truncated in the old PDB and affects the frh
- 4jfx truncated poorly in old DB (starts residue 26)
- 3v52 has a super long H3 that is truncated in the old PDB and affects the frh
- 4rgn has multiple Fvs in the PDB
- 4o51 has different numbering in the old PDB (why)
- 3v4u has a tricky H3 (appears to have been mis-parsed in the old PDB)
- 4a6y has multiple Fvs in the PDB
- 4o4y has different numbering in the old PDB (why)
- 4jo3 has different numbering in the old PDB (why)
- 4k3d has a super long H3 that is truncated in the old PDB and affects the frh
- 4k3e has a super long H3 that is truncated in the old PDB and affects the frh
- 4s1q has a super long H3 that is truncated in the old PDB and affects the frh
- 5bv7 has multiple Fvs in the PDB
- 4grw has a blatantly wrong old sequence...
- 4fnl has a super long H3 that is truncated in the old PDB and affects the frh
- 4jpv has different numbering in the old PDB (why)
- 3gk8 has different numbering in the old PDB (why)
- 4ma3 has different numbering in the old PDB (why)
- 3u1s has a super long H3 that is truncated in the old PDB and affects the frh
- 3zkx has multiple Fvs in the PDB

#### FRL Mismatches (3)

- 4rgn has multiple Fvs in the PDB
- 3lmr has more residues in the new db, because the old light chain is truncated
- 4jpv is misnubmered in the old db (lots of residues skipped around the CDR L1)

#### Orientation Mismatches (11)

- 3u6r has a residue insertion (L), due to a numbering difference.
- 1t2q has a residue insertion (L), due to a numbering difference.
- 1e4x has multiple Fvs in the PDB
- 3c5s has multiple Fvs in the PDB
- 1rhh has a residue insertion (L), due to a numbering difference.
- 3lmr has more residues in the new db, because the old light chain is truncated
- 2d03 has a residue insertion (L), due to a numbering difference.
- 1zlv has multiple Fvs in the PDB
- 3lh2 has multiple Fvs in the PDB
- 3gk8 has a residue insertion (HL), due to a numbering difference.
- 2gk0 has multiple Fvs in the PDB

#### Metric mismatches (numerous)
Metrics also do not match 100%. For the OCDs this is due to changes in which
chain is pulled from the PDB (when multiple chains are possible) because
the antibody structures will vary slightly across chains altering the PCA
results and the corresponding orientation metrics. For B-factors this is likely
because I do not use the same approach. Currently, I report the average B-factor
value across the entire loop (including side-chain atoms). I think the previous
approach set true/false if any backbone atom passed a threshold because my
current approach does not yield as many outliers.


## Future Directions

1. Is it necessary to use the whole light+heavy sequences for the orientation
alignment? Is this the best approach?
2. Should we create a region-based exclusion list (maybe this was the outlier
list from before)? There are some crazy, _e.g._ 4k3d, 5c7x, 5d7s, 5dt1
PDBs out there.
