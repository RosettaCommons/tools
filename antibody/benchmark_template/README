This directory contains subdirectories with FASTAs derived from the PDB / directory name.

You should copy this directory (twice) over before running grafting. 
In a sense, this is an integration test. In another, this is a scientific test.
Use one copy to run your baseline. Then your other copy can test something new
(e.g. a new database or a new definition for the CDR H2 or something).

You can use the shell scripts to run a quick graft (~5 mins per graft, but
10 grafts per Ab are usually run with multi-template grafting). There is no
need to run multi-template grafting unless this is a feature you'd like to test.
Use -antibody:n_multi_templates 1 to run with a single template only.

Run scripts as: `nohup ./run1.sh &> run1.out &`.

Scripts split the grafting tasks into smaller set so they can be run in parallel.

Once grafting has run, there are analysis scripts. The first will align Abs
on conserved residues and compute RMSDs for key structural regions.
The second will plot some of these results.

Requirements:
    - Rosetta executable "antibody" in your path
    - PyRosetta (for analysis)
    - R (for analysis)
